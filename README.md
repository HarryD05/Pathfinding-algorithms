# Pathfinding-algorithms
Experimenting with visualising path finding algorithms using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## To do list
- Add more comments
- Implement Dijkstra's algorithm
- Implement A* algorithm
- Refactor check node code to use iteration
- Add diagonal checks for node check functions
- Add directional edges

## Functionality
- Create a road network (using the draw/remove roads modes)
- Convert road network into a graph (change cost of edges)
- Use pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest distance (least cost) between 2 nodes on your graph using either Dijkstra's algorithm or A* (see the algorithm visualised)
